This is a Face Recognition Project Based on Smart Attendance System which is Build  Using Python & Machine Learning,
in this project we have used KNN(k-nearest neighbors) Algorithm in Order to build Face Recognition System.

After taking attendance we have stored the data in .CSV file and then displayed the attendance on Streamlit.

Also a simple GUI(graphical user-interface) is created using tkinter for ease of use!!


Steps:

1>   Run the tk.py for the GUI.

2>   Add the Real-time images and Name using Add Faces.

2>   Then Mark attendance through Step 2.

3>   Finally you can display your data(.csv file) on streamlit using Step 3.
