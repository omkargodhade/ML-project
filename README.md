This is a Face Recognition Project Based on Smart Attendance System which is Build  Using Python & Machine Learning,
in this project we have used KNN(k-nearest neighbors) Algorithm in Order to build Face Recognition System.

After taking attendance we have stored the data in .CSV file and then displayed the attendance on Streamlit.


Steps:

1>   Add the Real-time images and Name using add_img.py file.

2>   Then run test.py file for marking attendance.

3>   Finally you can display your data(.csv file) on streamlit using app.py file.
